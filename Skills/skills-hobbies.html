          <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skills:</h3>
            <p> <blockquote>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A skill that I have been hiding my whole life is that I know how to sing.<sup><b>1</b></sup> I discovered that I can sing when it was still pandemic. <sup><b>2</b></sup> 
          I started to sing while I was taking a bath, slowly I realized the basics and techniques of how to sing.<sup><b>3</b></sup> Another skill that I am really good at is driving cars and motorcycle.<sup><b>4</b></sup> 
          My father taught me how to drive a motorcycle when I was 8 years old.<sup><b>5</b></sup> Eversince that day, something in me sparked.<sup><b>6</b></sup> I thought that my only interest was with cars but 
          eventually I also realized how much I love motorcycles.<sup><b>7</b></sup> Having said that, I learned to drive a car when I was 14 years old.<sup><b>8</b></sup> Learning to drive both cars and motorcycles is
          a skill that I am blessed enough to have.<sup><b>9</b></sup> I am thankful to have such privilege and I am happy that I can help my family in some ways.<sup><b>10</b></sup> Maintaining the motorcycle I use daily
          is another skill that I have.<sup><b>11</b></sup> I myself, do basic maintenance for my motorcycle and also help my relatives that are in need of basic maintenance.<sup><b>12</b></sup> Having some knowledge of what to 
          do incase of unexpected circumstances on the road is something that I am prepared for.<sup><b>13</b></sup> Another hidden skill that I have is playing
          the guitar.<sup><b>14</b></sup> When I am bored, I play guitar and I just try to make my own versions of the songs that I like.<sup><b>15</b></sup> That said,
          being able to play the guitar brought me and my family closer as it served as our bonding.<sup><b>16</b></sup> Another skill that I have is am somewhat an athlete.<sup><b>17</b></sup> I have previously participated in basketball leagues
          and volleyball leagues.<sup><b>18</b></sup> Also, I won the MVP for volleyball in our intramurals before while wearing vans.<sup><b>19</b></sup> Lastly, basic trouble shooting of gadgets is something that I do.<sup><b>20</b></sup> 
          
            <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hobbies:</h3>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of my hobbies are also my skills.<sup><b>1</b></sup> My main hobby as of now is driving.<sup><b>2</b></sup>  I often kill time while driving a motorcycle because it brings me peace.<sup><b>3</b></sup> 
            Driving has been my go to hobby since I got my license because I also love travelling.<sup><b>4</b></sup>  Another hobby of mine is playing video games.<sup><b>5</b></sup> Since I was an elementary student playing video games has been one 
            of my hobbies to escape reality.<sup><b>6</b></sup> Playing video games such as Valorant, Counter-Strike and League of Legends have been a huge help for me to balance my academic life and time for my self.<sup><b>7</b></sup> Singing is also 
            a huge part of me.<sup><b>8</b></sup> Music is a huge part of my life and being able to sing the songs I like is huge blessing for me.<sup><b>9</b></sup> Singing is a blessing for me as it helps me release emotions that can't be spoken.<sup><b>10</b></sup>
            Another hobby of mine is watching movies and series related to the Mafia. <sup><b>11</b></sup> Watching such things made a huge impact in my life. <sup><b>12</b></sup>These kind of Series and Movies is my inspiration
            as it shows how to live in a high profile life and how to maintain public appearances while living a wealthy life.<sup><b>13</b></sup>Don't get me wrong, I will not do illegal things just to be successful in life,
            I just like their lifestyle and how cool they look.<sup><b>14</b></sup>Cycling is also one of my hobbies.<sup><b>15</b></sup>Riding the bicycle has been one of my favorite hobbies because even though it doesn't have an
            engine, it takes me to places where I want to go.<sup><b>16</b></sup> Cycling not only helps me travel, it also enables me to live a healthy life.<sup><b>17</b></sup>Cycling has also been my outlet when I was feeling 
            a little down or lonely.<sup><b>18</b></sup>My hobbies may be not that much but those things are the things that help me to escape reality and find peace.<sup><b>19</b></sup> These hobbies of mine helped me a lot when a lot of challenges
            came in my life and my families.<sup><b>20</b></sup>
          
          
        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interests:</h3>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of my obsession with motor vehicles, I am interested in gaining more knowledge on how to maintain motor vehicles.<sup><b>1</b></sup>Motor vehicles has been my interest
        since I was a child and now that I am closer to achieving my dreams, my interest for it sparked.<sup><b>2</b></sup>Building and customizing my own car and motorcycle is one of my main goals and now that
        I have a few years left in college, I know that soon enough, I'll be able to do it.<sup><b>3</b></sup>Another interest of mine is learning and gaining experience for programming or improving my knowledge
        about technology.<sup><b>4</b></sup>These things are important for me because I know that my field of work will always be connected to technology.<sup><b>5</b></sup>These things will be a key aspect for
        to achieve my ambitions and goals in life and I know for a fact that technology will always be part of our lives. <sup><b>6</b></sup>It is important for me to learn and improve on these things because I know that in the future,
        techonology will continue to enhance and new innovations will emerge, thus learning about it will be continous.<sup><b>7</b></sup> Another Interest of mine that I'll always have is travelling.<sup><b>8</b></sup>
        Travelling will always be my interest because I want to see what the world could offer.<sup><b>9</b></sup>Also, I often travel a lot to the Northern part of our country because my special person resides in Baguio
        and Isabela.<sup><b>10</b></sup> Traveling will always be part of our lives because in the future we plan to travel the world when we can.<sup><b>11</b></sup> Given that, my interests are working on motor vehicles, programming, and 
        travelling, music is also part of my interests.<sup><b>12</b></sup>Music, specifically music from 90's, will always have my interest.<sup><b>13</b></sup>Some people may find it weird, but to me, it is a work of art.<sup><b>14</b></sup>
        Old songs are one of my greatest interests because I love to sing it.<sup><b>15</b></sup>Singing those kind of songs give me fulfillment because when I reach the high notes, the reactions of the listeners are gold.<sup><b>16</b></sup>
        Having said that, since I am a human, I find unique and authentic foods interesting.<sup><b>17</b></sup>When me and my family travelled overseas, I tried a lot of authentic foods.<sup><b>18</b></sup>For some reason,
        being able to eat the food that people around me doesn't usually pick to eat gives me joy because I can see their reactions.<sup><b>19</b></sup>Nevertheless, I just really want to explore and try things that I can't usually do.<sup><b>20</b></sup>
